# for function 1
# It will always take 1 iteration as 
# a) It did not take a loop
# b) it took an arithmetic calculation thus giving a result of 1 iteration
# Also, this means it took the lowest time and iterations.

# For function 2
# It will take n iterations as
# a) it was run in a loop
# b) there were n numbers in the calculation which was added n times thus giving a result of n iterations
# It took an average time but will take a very long time to calculate if n was a large number

# For function 3
# It will take the sum from 1 to n iterations as
# a) it had an inner loop and an outer loop
# b) the inner loop decomposed the value of j into groups of 1 adding j iterations
# c) this means it decomposed all values of j into groups of 1 making it the sum of 1 to n iterations
# It has taken the longest time and even could take more space especially if n is a large number.
